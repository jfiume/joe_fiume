### Discussion

* I used create-react-app to create the skeleton for this project.
* I used the https://robohash.org/ api.
* A user inputs their text and React and Redux displays a robot. The robot spins for 10 seconds with the help of a CSS animation.
* I used the Heroku Buildpack for create-react-app.

#### Requirements
* Plan to spend 4-8 hours to complete. You can spend more time (or less, if this is really easy), but we donâ€™t need you to go overboard!
* Submit your herokuapp link
* Submit your source code via attachment or link to repo
